Stripe Integration
* Users should have a Stripe customer token in the users table
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user feels it out,
and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* Javascript should send user fields and card token to our Rails App for
validation.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info(email, plan id) and card token to 
Stripe server and Striple will create a subscription and send back customer
token. Rails should save customer token and user information to databse.
